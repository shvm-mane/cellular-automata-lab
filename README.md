## What is Cellular Automata?

Cellular automata are grid-based computational systems where
simple local rules create complex emergent behavior.

This project implements **Conway's Game of Life**,
one of the most famous cellular automata systems ever created.

The simulation demonstrates how:
- simple rules,
- local interactions,
- and discrete states

can generate highly complex global patterns.

## Conway's Game of Life Rules

Each cell exists in one of two states:

- Alive
- Dead

At every generation:

- Alive cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies
- Alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives
- Alive cell with more than 3 neighbors dies
- Dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive

## Implementations

### 1. CellPyLib Implementation

High-level implementation using the CellPyLib cellular automata library.

Features:
- Random initialization
- Text injection
- Animated evolution
- Fast prototyping

### 2. Pure Python + Pygame Implementation

Low-level implementation built completely from scratch using Pygame.

Features:
- Manual Conway rule engine
- Neighbor counting
- Real-time rendering
