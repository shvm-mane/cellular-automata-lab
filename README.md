# Cellular Automata

Conway's Game of Life implemented using:
- CellPyLib
- Pure Python + Pygame

This project explores emergence, cellular automata,
simulation systems, and procedural graphics.

Cellular automata are grid-based computational systems
where simple local rules create complex emergent behavior.

This project implements Conway's Game of Life,
one of the most famous cellular automata systems.

## Rules

- Alive cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies
- Alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives
- Alive cell with more than 3 neighbors dies
- Dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
